MissingOutputException in line 58 of /media/root/ocean/projects/ga/bracken_ribo_count/snakefiles/4_0_assembly.smk:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
tmp_coli/ODN-E-coli-1_S1_R1_001unmerged.fastq.gz
tmp_coli/ODN-E-coli-1_S1_R2_001unmerged.fastq.gz

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job merge_reads since they might be corrupted:
output_coli/LOGS/BBDUK/ODN-E-coli-1_S1_mering_reads.log
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
