MissingOutputException in line 32 of /media/root/ocean/projects/ga/bracken_ribo_count/snakefiles/4_0_assembly.smk:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
tmp_coli/ODN-E-coli-1_S1_R2_001filtered_repaired.fastq.gz
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job match_pairs_after_filtering since they might be corrupted:
tmp_coli/ODN-E-coli-1_S1_R1_001filtered_repaired.fastq.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
